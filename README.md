# airlock-masters
UBC Mars Colony code repository.

## Naming convention

### Files
To ensure the repository is quick to navigate, all Mars Colony files follow a naming convention, which include the project, subproject, functionality, etc. The base file name convention is below:

*Project-Module_Project-Part_Function-Name(_Sample).codetype*.

### Folders
Folders should be broken up into parts as well, to ensure code can be found as quickly as possible. For instance, the path to a CO2 Sensor file may be:

*airlock-masters/sensors/co2-sensor/sensors-co2-data-reporting/sensors-co2-data-reporting*
